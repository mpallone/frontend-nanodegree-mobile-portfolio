## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

#### Steps required to run application 
Simply point your browser at https://mpallone.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/ 

#### Optimizations made 
* Minified JavaScript and CSS.
* Optimized all images using Pagespeed Insights.
* Move CSS file references to be after inline JS, and marked inline analytics JS as async.
* Marked analytics scripts as async. 
* Marked print.css as 'media="print"'.
* Replaced URL images with "local" images, so that I could optimize them. 
* Inlined style.css. 
* Scrolling in pizza.html now batches the style changes to avoid breaking the JS -> Style -> Layout rule. 
* Rewrote changePizzaSlices to compute width only once, and to set the width in a separate loop to avoid breaking the JS -> Style -> Layout rule

#### Building the project 
I use gulp to minify CSS and JS. Simply type `gulp watch`, and any file modifications in the src directory will cause JS and CSS minifiers to run. (This could be more efficient, but for this simple project, who cares.)
